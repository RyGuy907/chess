Phase 0 is now complete. Things to review before the programming exam:
  specific java behavior and syntax
  tricky methods like the pawn one
  note every file which was updated and retrace my steps
  practice from scratch at least a few times spread over a few days
test

additionally for future reference:
  a lot of the continue; statements can probably be folded into one line and simplified and some piece methods use similar code and could also be further simplified


web api now completed, ready for db implementation
